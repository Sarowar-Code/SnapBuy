# Snapbuy E-commerce Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

---

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-   [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Learn about Next.js features and API.
-   [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - An interactive Next.js tutorial.
-   [Next.js GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Recommended Design Patterns for Beginners

### 1. **Component-Based Architecture**

-   Break your app into reusable components (e.g., `ProductCard`, `Header`, `Footer`).

### 2. **Container/Presentational Components**

-   Separate logic (e.g., fetching products) from UI (e.g., displaying products).

### 3. **Observer Pattern (for State Management)**

-   Use React‚Äôs **Context API** or **useState** for global state (e.g., cart).

### 4. **Singleton Pattern**

-   Centralize global cart or user authentication.

### 5. **Strategy Pattern (for Payment)**

-   Manage multiple payment methods (e.g., Stripe).

### 6. **MVC or Facade**

-   Use **API routes** as controllers for backend logic.

---

## In Conclusion

-   Start with simple patterns like **component-based design** and **basic state management**.
-   Gradually introduce advanced patterns as your project grows.

### **Essential Collections & Fields for Snapbuy**

Since you're building an e-commerce platform focused on **Home & Living**, your **MongoDB database** should include well-structured collections. Below are the key collections and their essential fields.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Products Collection** (Stores product details)

Each product should have details like **name, price, category, stock availability, and images**.

| **Field**     | **Type**      | **Description**                               |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `_id`         | ObjectId      | Unique identifier (automatically generated)   |
| `name`        | String        | Product name (e.g., "Modern Sofa")            |
| `description` | String        | Detailed product description                  |
| `price`       | Number        | Price of the product (e.g., 49.99)            |
| `category`    | String        | Product category (e.g., "Furniture")          |
| `stock`       | Number        | Number of available items                     |
| `images`      | Array[String] | URLs of product images (Cloudinary or GitHub) |
| `rating`      | Number        | Average rating (1-5)                          |
| `createdAt`   | Date          | Timestamp when product was added              |

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Users Collection** (Stores customer & admin details)

This collection will store **customer login details, roles, and profile information**.

| **Field**  | **Type**        | **Description**                                |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `_id`      | ObjectId        | Unique identifier                              |
| `name`     | String          | Full name of the user                          |
| `email`    | String          | User‚Äôs email (must be unique)                  |
| `password` | String (hashed) | Hashed password (if using email/password auth) |
| `role`     | String          | Role of user (`customer` or `admin`)           |

**Authentication Note:** Since you're using **NextAuth.js**, users might log in using Google or GitHub OAuth, so password storage is optional.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Orders Collection** (Tracks customer orders)

When a user places an order, this collection **stores order details, payment status, and shipping info**.

| **Field**     | **Type**      | **Description**                                         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_id`         | ObjectId      | Unique identifier                                       |
| `userId`      | ObjectId      | References the user who placed the order                |
| `products`    | Array[Object] | List of purchased products (productId, quantity, price) |
| `totalAmount` | Number        | Total cost of the order                                 |
| `status`      | String        | Order status (`pending`, `shipped`, `delivered`)        |
| `createdAt`   | Date          | Timestamp when order was placed                         |

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Cart Collection (Optional)** (Stores temporary shopping cart data)

If you're **not** using local storage for the shopping cart, you can store cart items in MongoDB.

| **Field**   | **Type**      | **Description**                          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `_id`       | ObjectId      | Unique identifier                        |
| `userId`    | ObjectId      | References the user‚Äôs cart               |
| `products`  | Array[Object] | List of cart items (productId, quantity) |
| `createdAt` | Date          | Timestamp when cart was last updated     |

###Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)
Use localStorage for fast access while the user is active.
Sync the cart to MongoDB when the user logs in or after a certain time.
If the user logs out, you can merge their local cart with the database cart when they return.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Categories Collection (Optional)** (Manages product categories)

Instead of hardcoding product categories, you can **store them in a separate collection**.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description**                             |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `_id`     | ObjectId | Unique identifier                           |
| `name`    | String   | Category name (e.g., "Furniture", "Decor")  |
| `slug`    | String   | SEO-friendly identifier (e.g., `furniture`) |

---

### **Additional Considerations**

-   **Reviews Collection** (If you want user reviews for products)
-   **Wishlist Collection** (If you want users to save favorite products)
-   **Coupons Collection** (If you want to offer discounts)
